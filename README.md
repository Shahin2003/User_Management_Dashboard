# User Management Dashboard

## Overview

This web application features a user management dashboard with two tabs: User Details and Account Creation. The User Details tab displays user information fetched from a placeholder database in a searchable table format, while the Account Creation tab consists of a form for username and password input. This project aims to provide a clean and intuitive dashboard layout for managing user data.

- **User Details Tab:**
  - Fetch user data from a placeholder database.
  - Implemented a searchable table displaying user information: Username, Email, Phone, ID, and Creation date.
  - Enable a click action on any user in the search results to open a popup/modal with a button to generate a report for the selected user.

- **Account Creation Tab:**
  - Create a form with fields for username and password.
  - Implement dummy request handling upon form submission.
